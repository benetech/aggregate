local-repository directory
--------------------------

The local-repository directory is not to be confused with the local repository in your 
maven installation (normally at ~/.m2/repository).  This directory has been added so that
jars not or no longer available through a public maven repository can be kept with this 
project and their dependencies handled seamlessly with pom.xml configuration files.

Using the local-repository folder is a last resort, after you've exhausted public 
repository options for a new jar.  However, if a necessary jar is not available in 
maven, you can add it to the local-respository folder with the following command:

mvn deploy:deploy-file -Durl=file:///YOUR-DIRECTORY-PATH-TO-AGGREGATE/aggregate/local-repository \
-Dfile=odk-tomcatutil-1.0.1.jar \
-DgroupId=org.opendatakit \
-DartifactId=odk-tomcatutil \
-Dpackaging=jar \
-Dversion=1.0.1

This will create the necessary file framework in the local-directory directory so that
you can include jars in aggregate project pom.files.  So far, the local-repository 
repository and dependencies are used only in aggregate-src/pom.xml

Summary of what is installed.

# javarosa-libraries:

This is a special build of javarosa using the tree at https://bitbucket.org/m.sundt/javarosa
It incorporates multithread-safe KoBo collect changes (from Clayton), abandons J2ME support, 
exposes bind and prompt attributes, and numerous contributed fixes from SurveyCTO and others.

# odk-httpclient-gae-4.5.2:

This can be installed by pulling the Aggregate (Components) sources
and running 'mvn install' in the GaeHttpClient project.  

# odk-tomcatutil-1.0.1:

This can be installed by pulling the Aggregate (Components) sources
and running 'mvn install' in the TomcatUtils project.  Or,

# gwt-google-maps-v3-1.0.1:

This can be installed by pulling the Aggregate (Components) sources
and building the gwt-google-maps-v3 project. 
See the Aggregate (Components) README.txt file for how this was built. It
uses the sources that were originally located here (but have since been removed):
http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-maps-v3/

# gwt-visualization-1.1.2:

The sources are in the jar. The full project can be found in 
the Aggregate (Components) project. It is copied from the download
formerly available here:
  http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-apis/
